| ✓ Outlier Detection | ASSUMED | Part of data preprocessing |
| ✗ Data Leakage Checks | **NOT EXPLICITLY DONE** | Should verify no leakage |
| ✓ Feature Consistency | DONE | Same features in train/val/test |

**Recommendation**: Explicit data leakage audit

## 10. MODEL INTERPRETABILITY

| Practice | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| ✓ Feature Importance | DONE | LightGBM provides feature_importances_ |
| ✗ SHAP Values | **PLANNED** | Notebook exists but not executed |
| ✗ Partial Dependence Plots | **NOT DONE** | Would be helpful for stakeholders |
| ✓ Simple Baseline | DONE | DummyClassifier included (ROC-AUC 0.50) |

**Recommendation**: Execute SHAP analysis for model interpretation

## PRIORITY ACTIONS (Ranked)

### HIGH PRIORITY (Do Now)
1. **Re-run 12 experiments with 5-fold CV** - Critical for robust model selection
2. **Log training metrics** - Essential for overfitting detection
3. **Run hyperparameter optimization** - On best config from CV experiments

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Before Production)
4. **Threshold optimization** - Optimize decision threshold for business needs
5. **Model calibration check** - Ensure probabilities are well-calibrated
6. **Data leakage audit** - Verify no information leakage

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)
7. **Feature selection** - Reduce dimensionality if needed
8. **SHAP analysis** - Better model interpretation
9. **Learning curves** - Diagnose learning behavior
10. **Cost-sensitive learning** - Incorporate business costs
